# Fourier-series-matlab
A Simple MATLAB script for Fourier series coefficients in exponential form.

More number of coefficients can be added if needed as fourier series coeffients increase as the function becomes complicated.

If more number of coefficients are included better reconstruction will be obtained. 

The series can be obtained by

f(t) = summation n from -inf to inf (in this case -16 to 16) [ Cn* exp(j * 2 * pi * n * t/T) ]
