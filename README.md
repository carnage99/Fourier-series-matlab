# Fourier_series_matlab
Fourier series coefficients in exponential form. 
More number of coefficients can be added if needed as fourier series coeffients increase as the function becomes compicated. 
If more number of coefficients are incuded better reconstruction will be obtained. 
The series can be obtained by f(t) = summation n from -inf to inf (in this case -16 to 16) [ Cn* exp(j * 2 * pi * n * t/T) ]
